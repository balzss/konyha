# Introduction

Konyha Recipe Manager is a self hostable web app to manage, store and share recipes. It is written in TypeScript and you
need Node and Docker to run it. Multiple users can use the same instance.

### How it works

After installation the app instance can be accessed under the `app.example.com` subdomain and any number of user can register and log in
with their Google or Github account (email is coming soon). Each user can store and access their recipes after
authentication.

Users can publish their recipes as a static site for sharing. Published status can be set per recipe. Site generation is
automatic and instant.
